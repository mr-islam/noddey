# Noddey

Inspired from everyone's childhood favorite character, Noddy. Made for my Introduction to Computer Science Class.

Kind of a scrappy logic that won't scale well to anyhting beyond it's current scope, but this was a good chance to get Node.js set up and explore some of its APIs.

Talk about movies, hobbies, colors, food, sports â€” or anything else. Noddey will entertain any thought.
